# SVD
This is an app using SVD to construct an approximation of a gray-scale image. In order to use this app, you have to install required module such as tkinter, cv2, etc.
# Guide:
- Choose an image from your computer
- Press "Process image" button
- Enter the rank you want, this rank must not be greater than the maximum rank
- Press "OK" button
- Press "Save" if you want to save reconstructed image
# Example
- I use an image of anime "Your name" as an example. After choosing the image and processing it, i get the max rank of the image: 413

- This is the image when i choose to reconstruct it with rank 25

- This is the image when i choose to reconstruct it with rank 50

- This is the image when i choose to reconstruct it with rank 75

- This is the image when i choose to reconstruct it with rank 100

- This is the image when i choose to reconstruct it with rank 200

- This is the image when i choose to reconstruct it with rank 400
